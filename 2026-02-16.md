### Modern CSS Code Snippets: Stop writing CSS like it's 2015
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.2/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Most developers still rely on JavaScript hacks and preprocessor workarounds for styling problems that CSS now solves natively, creating unnecessary complexity and performance overhead.

**一句话总结**: Modern CSS (2024-2026) provides native replacements for 64+ common styling patterns that previously required JavaScript, Sass, or fragile hacks, with most features now at 85%+ browser support.

**关键要点**:
• Layout patterns like centering (place-items: center), preventing scroll chaining (overscroll-behavior), and scrollbar gutter management (scrollbar-gutter: stable) eliminate common JS dependencies
• Color workflow revolution: oklch() enables perceptually uniform color manipulation where only lightness changes, replacing guess-and-check hex adjustments
• Form and input enhancements include :user-invalid/:user-valid pseudo-classes (85% support), field-sizing: content for auto-growing textareas (73%), and interpolate-size for smooth height: auto animations (69%)
• Emerging low-support features (35-50%) signal the future: CSS if() statements, attr() with typed values, @container scroll-state() for sticky detection, and :target-current for scroll spy
• Browser support varies dramatically: stable features like object-fit and backdrop-filter at 96%, while cutting-edge workflow tools like native CSS functions (@function) and corner-shape at 67%

**背景**: CSS has undergone a transformation since 2015, with the 'New CSS' era bringing container queries, cascade layers, native nesting, and dozens of previously-impossible features. This article catalogs practical before/after comparisons showing which legacy techniques can be safely retired.
