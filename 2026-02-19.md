### Current - An RSS reader
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This article offers a rare philosophical deep-dive into RSS reader design, proposing 'phantom obligation' as a genuine UX problem and presenting concrete solutions that challenge two decades of feed-reading conventions.

**一句话总结**: Current is a new RSS reader that eliminates unread counts and 'mark as read' mechanics in favor of a time-based 'river' where articles naturally age out, treating information consumption as flow rather than task management.

**关键要点**:
• The concept of 'phantom obligation' — guilt for uncompleted reading that no one actually demanded — is traced to NetNewsWire 2002 and identified as the root problem in RSS design
• Articles have configurable 'velocity' (half-life): Breaking (3 hours), News (18 hours), Article (1 day), Essay (3 days), Evergreen (7 days), preventing prolific sources from drowning slower ones
• The 'release' gesture replaces 'mark as read' with physics-based haptic feedback, undo windows, and automatic navigation — language and interaction design treated as emotional design
• Voices feature distinguishes personal blogs from publications using automatic detection (subdomain patterns, byline signals, post frequency), presenting people differently than feeds
• All intelligence (NLP topic detection, Foundation Model verification) runs on-device with zero server communication — a privacy-first architecture for habit detection

**背景**: RSS readers have followed largely the same interaction model since the early 2000s: unread counts, inbox metaphors, and completionist mechanics borrowed from email. This article argues that model fundamentally misunderstands how people actually want to relate to information streams.

### 🟡 DNS-PERSIST-01: A New Model for DNS-based Challenge Validation
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.2/10

**为什么重要**: This eliminates a major operational pain point for certificate automation by removing DNS updates from the renewal critical path, reducing credential exposure and propagation delays for organizations managing large-scale TLS deployments.

**要点**:
• DNS-PERSIST-01 requires publishing one TXT record at _validation-persist.<domain> containing the CA identifier and ACME account URI, which then authorizes all future issuance and renewals for that account
• The authorization can be scoped with policy=wildcard to include wildcard certificates (*.example.com) and matching subdomains, or limited with persistUntil=<unix_timestamp> for time-bound security
• Security tradeoff: DNS-PERSIST-01 reduces attack surface by eliminating distributed DNS API credentials, but shifts critical protection burden to the ACME account private key
