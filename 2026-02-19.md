### Bliki: Agentic Email
**来源**: Martin Fowler | **评分**: 7.5/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Agentic email systems are being adopted by senior leaders without adequate security safeguards, creating a ticking time bomb for account takeovers and data breaches.

**一句话总结**: While LLM agents handling email offer compelling productivity benefits, they create a dangerous 'Lethal Trifecta' of untrusted content, sensitive information, and external communication that makes them highly vulnerable to exploitation.

**关键要点**:
• The 'Lethal Trifecta' (coined by Simon Willison): untrusted content + sensitive information + external communication creates a critical security vulnerability in agentic systems
• Password reset workflows through email make agents especially dangerous—attackers can socially engineer the agent itself to intercept account recovery flows
• One mitigation approach: sandbox agents with read-only email access, no internet connectivity, and human review of drafted responses in plain text (eliminating one leg of the trifecta)
• Real exploit demonstrated: William Peltomäki showed how a single email turned his clawdbot into a data leak
• Current false sense of security: no major breaches reported yet, but attack surface is expanding rapidly as senior/powerful users adopt these tools

**背景**: Agentic AI refers to LLM-based systems that can autonomously take actions (not just generate text). Email is a high-value target for automation due to communication overload, but it also contains the keys to most digital identities through password resets and sensitive personal/professional information.

### 🔴 15 years of FP64 segmentation, and why the Blackwell Ultra breaks the pattern
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.4/10

**为什么重要**: This article reveals how the AI boom is fundamentally reshaping GPU market segmentation, with enterprise hardware now abandoning the FP64 advantage that justified 20x price premiums for 15 years.

**要点**:
• FP64:FP32 ratio on consumer GPUs degraded from 1:8 (Fermi 2010) to 1:64 (Ampere 2020/RTX 5090), while absolute FP64 performance only grew 9.65x vs 77.63x for FP32 over 15 years
• Enterprise-to-consumer GPU price ratio widened from ~5x (2010) to over 20x (2022), with FP64 serving as the primary technical differentiator alongside ECC memory and NVLink
• Nvidia's 2017 GeForce EULA datacenter restriction marked an unprecedented shift from implicit technical segmentation to explicit contractual market division
