### Jimi Hendrix was a systems engineer
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.2/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This article reframes artistic genius as engineering methodology, offering a reproducible, systems-thinking approach to understanding how Hendrix pioneered electric guitar sound design through deliberate signal chain manipulation rather than inexplicable talent.

**一句话总结**: Jimi Hendrix functioned as a systems engineer who systematically augmented the electric guitar's limitations through a modular analog signal chain of pedals, feedback loops, and physical positioning to transform it into a wave synthesizer capable of human-like expression.

**关键要点**:
• The 'cleanup effect' in Hendrix's sound emerged from the Fuzz Face's low input impedance (~20 kΩ) interacting directly with guitar pickups—reducing volume restores sinusoidal waveform, allowing fuzz to drop in and out dynamically during performance
• Roger Mayer's custom Octavia pedal used a rectifier circuit to flip waveform troughs into peaks, doubling frequency and creating the distinctive octave-higher harmonic bloom heard on 'Purple Haze' (recorded 3 February 1967)
• Hendrix's complete signal chain formed a gain-controlled acoustic feedback system: driving the Marshall 100-watt amplifier near saturation extended sustain, while moving centimeters relative to speakers shifted between stable feedback modes, enabling real-time 'tuning' of sirens, bombs, and harmonics
• The author created fully reproducible ngspice circuit simulations of Hendrix's entire chain (Fuzz Face germanium/silicon variants, Octavia, wah-wah, Uni-Vibe) with source code available at github.com/nahorov/Hendrix-Systems-Lab
• Each pedal addressed specific guitar limitations: Fuzz Face reshaped envelope attack/decay, wah-wah (300 Hz–2 kHz band-pass) created vocal 'talking' effects, and Uni-Vibe's four phase-shift sections modulated by photoresistors added motion and air

**背景**: The electric guitar prior to Hendrix had a 'barking' envelope—hard attack, fast decay, poor sustain compared to bowed strings or organs. Early hollow-body electric guitars failed to solve this. Hendrix's innovation was treating the entire signal path as an instrument rather than using effects as afterthoughts.

### 🟡 Making MCP cheaper via CLI
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.0/10

**为什么重要**: AI agents waste 94% of tokens loading tool schemas they never use, and this simple CLI-based approach slashes costs while working with any model—not just Anthropic.

**要点**:
• MCP's upfront schema loading costs ~15,540 tokens for 84 tools (6 servers × 14 tools), while CLI's lightweight skill listing costs only ~300 tokens—a 98% savings at session start
• CLI trades upfront cost for on-demand discovery: --help calls add ~600 tokens per tool group, but total usage stays ~94% lower even with 100 tool calls
• Anthropic's Tool Search achieves 85% savings but still loses to CLI: 40% more expensive at startup, 74% more expensive for single tool use, and 88% more expensive at scale
