### Google API keys weren't secrets, but then Gemini changed the rules
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 8.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Google's decade-old advice that API keys are safe to embed in public code has been silently invalidated by Gemini, leaving thousands of organizations unknowingly exposed to data theft and billing fraud.

**一句话总结**: Google API keys originally designed as non-sensitive public identifiers for services like Maps have retroactively gained access to sensitive Gemini AI endpoints without warning, creating a widespread privilege escalation vulnerability.

**关键要点**:
• Google explicitly told developers for over a decade that API keys (AIza...) were safe to embed client-side—Firebase's security checklist literally states 'API keys are not secrets'
• Researchers found 2,863 live exposed keys in the November 2025 Common Crawl, including keys from major financial institutions, security companies, and Google itself
• The attack is trivial: scrape a Maps key from any website's HTML, then use it to access /files/ and /cachedContents/ endpoints containing private data and rack up AI charges
• Google initially dismissed the report as 'intended behavior' on Nov 25, 2025, only reclassifying it as a bug after researchers provided proof-of-concept using Google's own exposed keys
• Root cause: single key format for both public identification and sensitive authentication violates secure API design principles (no separation of publishable vs. secret keys)

**背景**: Google Cloud uses one API key format (AIza...) across all services. When Gemini launched, existing unrestricted keys in projects with the Generative Language API enabled automatically gained access to sensitive endpoints—no migration, no notification. This represents a fundamental architectural debt where a billing identifier system was repurposed for authentication without architectural safeguards.

### 🔴 Against Query Based Compilers
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.3/10

**为什么重要**: This article challenges the prevailing wisdom that query-based compilers are a silver bullet for incremental compilation, offering concrete architectural alternatives that could save years of engineering effort on new language tooling.

**要点**:
• Query-based compilers have a fundamental Big-O limitation: update work cannot be smaller than the change in result, making them ineffective for operations with 'avalanche properties' like hashing or encryption where small input changes flip half the output bits
• Zig vs. Rust comparison demonstrates how language design determines query necessity: Zig's explicit name declarations and file-isolated parsing avoid queries entirely, while Rust's macros and crate-wide name resolution force fine-grained dependency tracking from the start
• Rust's trait system creates particularly nasty query overhead—every trait method call depends not just on the found impl block, but on proving non-existence of conflicting impls across all files

### 🟡 Jimi Hendrix was a systems engineer
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.0/10

**为什么重要**: This article demonstrates how engineering analysis can demystify creative genius, providing a reproducible, inspectable framework for understanding Hendrix's revolutionary sound design that remains relevant for modern audio engineers and musicians.

**要点**:
• Hendrix's signal chain for 'Purple Haze' (recorded 3 February 1967) consisted of a Fuzz Face, Octavia, wah-wah pedal, and Marshall 100-watt amplifier stack, with the guitar and room acoustics forming a closed feedback loop he tuned with his body position
• The Fuzz Face's low input impedance (~20 kΩ) creates the 'cleanup effect' where reducing guitar volume restores sinusoidal wave shape, allowing dynamic fuzz control—this interaction between pickup inductance (2.5 H) and pedal circuit was intentional, not malfunction
• The custom Octavia pedal used a rectifier to flip waveform troughs into peaks, doubling frequency and producing second-harmonic content an octave above the fundamental—so novel that remastering engineers required explanatory notes
