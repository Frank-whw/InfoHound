### Claude Sonnet 4.6
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 represents a significant inflection point where mid-tier pricing now delivers frontier-level performance, making high-end AI capabilities economically viable for production workloads that previously required expensive Opus-class models.

**一句话总结**: Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.6 closes the gap with Opus-level intelligence at 1/5th the cost, featuring major advances in computer use, 1M token context, and agentic reasoning that developers prefer over the previous flagship 59% of the time.

**关键要点**:
• Performance breakthrough: Early users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Opus 4.5 59% of the time, citing reduced 'laziness,' fewer hallucinations, and better instruction following—previously impossible at the $3/$15 per million token price point
• Computer use leap: Achieved 94% on insurance benchmarks and human-level capability on complex spreadsheets/multi-step web forms, with major improvements in prompt injection resistance compared to Sonnet 4.5
• Strategic reasoning demonstrated: In Vending-Bench Arena, Sonnet 4.6 independently developed a novel 'invest early, pivot to profit' strategy that outperformed competitors by timing capacity investments before profitability focus
• Enterprise validation: Box measured 15 percentage point improvement in heavy reasoning Q&A; Rakuten AI reported 'genuinely surprising' iOS code quality with modern tooling selection; financial services saw significant answer match rate jumps
• Infrastructure expansion: 1M token context window (beta) with context compaction, plus adaptive/extended thinking modes on the Developer Platform—enabling entire codebase analysis and long-horizon planning without cost increases

**背景**: Anthropic operates a tiered model strategy with Opus (frontier, expensive), Sonnet (balanced), and Haiku (fast, cheap). Sonnet 4.6 follows their October 2024 introduction of general-purpose computer use, which allows AI to control computers via mouse/keyboard rather than APIs. The OSWorld benchmark and Vending-Bench Arena are industry standards for measuring agentic capabilities and long-term strategic reasoning respectively.
