### Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.3/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This represents a major browser engine's pragmatic adoption of memory-safe languages, demonstrating how AI-assisted translation can accelerate large-scale codebase migrations that were previously impractical.

**一句话总结**: Ladybird browser is incrementally rewriting its JavaScript engine from C++ to Rust using AI-assisted translation, achieving byte-for-byte identical output with zero regressions across 65,359 tests in two weeks versus estimated months by hand.

**关键要点**:
• AI-assisted translation used Claude Code and Codex through hundreds of human-directed prompts, followed by adversarial review passes with multiple models to catch errors
• First target was LibJS (lexer, parser, AST, bytecode generator): ~25,000 lines of Rust produced with verified byte-for-byte identical output to C++ pipeline
• Zero regressions: 52,898 test262 tests and 12,461 Ladybird regression tests all passed; no performance regressions on tracked JS benchmarks
• Rust chosen despite poor fit for 1990s-style OOP web platform model due to mature ecosystem, safety guarantees, and precedent from Firefox/Chromium adoption
• Swift previously rejected due to insufficient C++ interop and limited non-Apple platform support; Rust code intentionally non-idiomatic initially to maintain C++ compatibility

**背景**: Ladybird is a new independent browser engine project founded by Andreas Kling (formerly Safari/WebKit at Apple). The project has been evaluating memory-safe alternatives to C++ for system components, with this announcement marking their committed direction after earlier hesitation about Rust's fit for OOP-heavy browser architectures.

### 🟡 The Age Verification Trap: Verifying age undermines everyone's data protection
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.4/10

**为什么重要**: Age verification laws are spreading globally, yet this article reveals how they systematically erode privacy protections for all users while failing to achieve their stated goal of protecting children.

**要点**:
• Platforms have only two technical tools for age enforcement: identity-based verification (government IDs, with gaps for 16-year-olds in many jurisdictions) and inference-based systems (behavioral signals, facial age estimation), which platforms combine into escalating, recurring checks rather than one-time verification.
• Meta's Instagram uses AI-powered video selfie checks through third parties; TikTok scans public videos for age inference; Google/YouTube use behavioral signals with credit cards as adulthood proxies; Roblox's new system already suffers from children selling accounts to adult predators.
• The verification trap operates through litigation risk: when regulators ask 'did you take reasonable steps,' platforms must log, retain, and monitor user data indefinitely to prove compliance, making 'we collected less data' a legally indefensible position.

### 🟡 So I've Been Thinking About Static Site Generators
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.2/10

**为什么重要**: This article reveals why even 'fast' SSGs like Hugo are architecturally limited, and how proper incremental builds using the Red-Green algorithm could achieve sub-100ms rebuilds instead of full site rebuilds.

**要点**:
• Most SSGs claiming 'fast rebuilds' actually do full clean builds; the author identifies this as a missed opportunity for true incremental compilation using algorithms like Rust's Red-Green approach
• Profiling Astro revealed that only 0.4s of a 12.34s build was syscalls—the rest was JavaScript overhead, leading to the conclusion that SSGs must be built in compiled languages with single-process architectures
• The core technical challenge is over-rebuilding: when a page's metadata changes, naive dependency tracking marks all pages dirty (due to 'next/previous' links), but Red-Green allows marking steps 'green' (unchanged) even with 'red' dependencies if outputs don't change
