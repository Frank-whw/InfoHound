### I Ported Coreboot to the ThinkPad X270
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.5/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This is one of the rare documented cases of successfully porting Coreboot to a new laptop model, including the actual hardware debugging process and community collaboration that made it possible.

**一句话总结**: A developer successfully ported Coreboot/Libreboot to the ThinkPad X270 in under a week after fixing a self-inflicted hardware damage and resolving PCIe clock routing differences from the similar X280 model.

**关键要点**:
• The X270 (Kaby Lake, 20HM model) differs from the X280 in critical ways: no Thunderbolt, SODIMM slot vs. soldered RAM, and crucially different PCIe CLKREQ routing—CLKREQ2 vs CLKREQ1 for WiFi, which was the key fix for NVMe/WiFi detection failures
• Hardware debugging involved knocking off a 10uF 0603 capacitor during SOIC-8 chip clip flashing, requiring schematic analysis via 'PJ304' silkscreen marking and Digikey replacement
• Used RP2040-zero with pico-serprog and flashprog for SPI flashing; extracted IFD, GbE, and ME regions with ifdtool; applied deguard for ME neutering without requiring a vulnerable ME version
• The breakthrough fix involved correcting PCIe clock request assignments after comparing X280 and X270 schematics—CLKREQ4 goes nowhere on X280 but serves dual WiGig/WiFi on X270's single card
• Full upstreaming in progress with working linux-libre compatibility planned via ath9k USB dongle, moving toward fully free software stack on modern-ish hardware

**背景**: Coreboot is an open-source firmware alternative to proprietary BIOS/UEFI. Libreboot is a downstream distribution that removes binary blobs. The ThinkPad X270 (2017) is a popular business laptop that previously lacked Coreboot support. 'Deguard' is a tool for neutering Intel Management Engine, a controversial subsystem in Intel chips.
