### Turn Dependabot Off
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.3/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Dependabot's high false-positive rate creates alert fatigue that wastes engineering time and actually degrades security posture by drowning out real threats, while better alternatives exist that use Go's rich vulnerability metadata for precise, actionable alerts.

**一句话总结**: The author argues Dependabot should be replaced with govulncheck for security scanning and scheduled CI runs against latest dependencies, because Dependabot's crude module-level matching generates thousands of irrelevant PRs while missing the actual attack surface analysis.

**关键要点**:
• Dependabot opened thousands of PRs for a filippo.io/edwards25519 vulnerability affecting only the unused `(*Point).MultiScalarMult` method, even flagging repos like Wycheproof that only imported the unaffected `field` subpackage
• The Go Vulnerability Database contains symbol-level metadata (package, function, version) that enables precise filtering—govulncheck uses static analysis to determine if vulnerable code is actually reachable, reporting 'Your code is affected by 0 vulnerabilities' when the symbol isn't called
• Alert fatigue from false positives causes teams to treat all security alerts as routine dependency bumps, preventing proper impact assessment (secrets rotation, user notification, production updates) for genuine vulnerabilities
• Dependency freshness can be achieved without constant PR noise by running CI daily with `go get -u -t ./...` before tests—this catches breakage early without forcing updates, and reduces risk by avoiding rushed refactors when security patches are needed
• The author, former Go Security Team lead, notes this was the motivation for building the Go Vulnerability Database and govulncheck in 2020–2021 to solve the exact problem Dependabot ignores

**背景**: Dependabot is GitHub's automated dependency update tool that monitors for vulnerabilities and opens PRs to update affected packages. The Go ecosystem has unique advantages for precise vulnerability detection because the Go Vulnerability Database (maintained by the Go security team) includes rich metadata about which specific functions/symbols are vulnerable, not just which module versions.

### 🟡 I found a Vulnerability. They found a Lawyer
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.0/10

**为什么重要**: This case exemplifies how organizations weaponize legal threats against security researchers practicing responsible disclosure, chilling future vulnerability reporting and leaving critical flaws unpatched.

**要点**:
• The vulnerability was trivially exploitable: incrementing numeric user IDs (XXXXXX0, XXXXXX1, etc.) combined with a static default password never forced to be changed, with no rate limiting, lockouts, or MFA.
• Exposed data included full personal profiles of underage students: names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, dates of birth—verified for a 14-year-old whose account was accessible with just a guessed number and default password.
• The researcher followed Malta's National Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy exactly, notifying both CSIRT Malta and the organization with a 30-day embargo.
