### Show HN: Moonshine Open-Weights STT models – higher accuracy than WhisperLargev3
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 8.3/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Moonshine delivers faster, more accurate on-device speech recognition than OpenAI's Whisper while solving critical real-time streaming limitations that make Whisper unsuitable for live voice interfaces.

**一句话总结**: Moonshine is an open-source, on-device speech-to-text toolkit optimized for real-time streaming that outperforms Whisper Large v3 in accuracy (6.65% vs 7.44% WER) with 100x lower latency (107ms vs 11,286ms on MacBook Pro) and models as small as 26MB.

**关键要点**:
• Moonshine Medium Streaming achieves 6.65% WER vs Whisper Large v3's 7.44% WER, despite having 6x fewer parameters (245M vs 1.5B) and running 105x faster on MacBook Pro (107ms vs 11,286ms latency)
• Solves Whisper's fundamental architectural flaws for live speech: fixed 30-second input windows causing wasted computation on zero-padding, and lack of caching forcing redundant processing on repeated calls
• Supports true streaming with incremental audio addition and cached encoder/decoder state, enabling sub-200ms responsiveness critical for voice interfaces
• Offers language-specific models (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Arabic) that outperform multilingual Whisper—only 33 of 82 Whisper languages achieve sub-20% WER vs Moonshine's focused accuracy
• Single cross-platform C++ core with OnnxRuntime deploys identically across Python, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, and IoT/wearables with native language bindings

**背景**: OpenAI's Whisper (2022) democratized open-source speech recognition but was designed for batch transcription, not live applications. The Moonshine team, after hitting Whisper's limitations building real-time voice products, developed purpose-built streaming architectures with flexible input windows and state caching—achieving both higher accuracy and dramatically lower latency through architectural innovation rather than scale.

### 🟡 I'm helping my dog vibe code games
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.1/10

**为什么重要**: This demonstrates how creative prompt engineering and automated tooling can turn even random noise into structured software output, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI-assisted development.

**要点**:
• The core innovation is a carefully crafted prompt that frames random input as 'secret cryptic commands' from an eccentric game designer, combined with strict guardrails (checklist: working audio, WASD controls, visible player, enemies) that improved output quality dramatically
• The full pipeline: Bluetooth keyboard → Raspberry Pi 5 → Rust proxy (DogKeyboard) that filters dangerous keys → Claude Code → smart treat dispenser triggered by input volume, with games built in 1-2 hours using Godot 4.6 and C#
• Critical tooling for reliability: Python screenshot capture, automated input sequences for QA testing (Claude played through 6 stages to verify a boss fight), plus linters for Godot scenes and shaders that eliminated cryptic runtime errors
