### Show HN: Moonshine Open-Weights STT models – higher accuracy than WhisperLargev3
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.8/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Moonshine solves the critical latency and accuracy problems that make Whisper unsuitable for real-time voice applications, offering 5-100x faster inference with better accuracy on everything from MacBooks to Raspberry Pis.

**一句话总结**: Moonshine is a new family of open-weights speech-to-text models optimized for live streaming that outperforms Whisper Large V3 in accuracy while running 100x faster on streaming tasks through architectural innovations like flexible input windows and caching.

**关键要点**:
• Achieves 6.65% WER vs Whisper Large V3's 7.44% with 6x fewer parameters (245M vs 1.5B), and delivers 107ms latency on MacBook Pro compared to 11,286ms for Whisper Large V3
• Eliminates Whisper's 30-second fixed window constraint with flexible input lengths and implements caching for streaming, avoiding redundant computation on previously-seen audio
• Offers language-specific models (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Arabic) that achieve higher accuracy than multilingual models at equivalent sizes
• Provides unified cross-platform deployment via portable C++ core with native bindings for Python, Swift, Java, and C++ across iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, Windows, and Raspberry Pi
• Includes batteries-included APIs for transcription, speaker diarization, and semantic command recognition without requiring ML expertise

**背景**: Whisper revolutionized open-source STT but was designed for batch processing, not live voice interfaces. Its 30-second fixed window, lack of caching, and poor multilingual accuracy made it impractical for real-time applications. Moonshine was built specifically to address these limitations through architectural redesign rather than incremental optimization.

### 🟡 I'm helping my dog vibe code games
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.1/10

**为什么重要**: This demonstrates how creative prompt engineering and automated feedback loops can turn even chaotic input into functional software, offering a blueprint for human-AI collaboration that doesn't require traditional coding skills.

**要点**:
• The breakthrough prompt framed Momo's random keystrokes as 'cryptic genius' from an eccentric game designer, enabling Claude to interpret 'y7u8888888ftrg34BC' as a 3D frog bug-catching game called 'Swamp Snacker'
• Automated feedback tools—screenshots and simulated gameplay input—were the single biggest lever for quality, allowing Claude to act as its own QA tester and play through all 6 stages of a game to verify the final boss fight worked
• Godot 4.6 with C# was chosen over Rust/Bevy (poorer visuals, coordinate confusion) and Unity (MCP bridge instability); Godot's text-based .tscn scene files allowed Claude to read and edit scenes directly
