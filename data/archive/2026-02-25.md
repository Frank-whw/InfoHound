### Show HN: Moonshine Open-Weights STT models – higher accuracy than WhisperLargev3
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.8/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Moonshine achieves 6.65% WER vs Whisper Large v3's 7.44% with 16x fewer parameters and 100x lower latency, finally making real-time, on-device voice interfaces practical across resource-constrained devices.

**一句话总结**: Moonshine is a new family of open-weight speech-to-text models optimized for live streaming that outperforms Whisper Large v3 in accuracy while running 100x faster on consumer hardware through architectural innovations like flexible input windows and caching.

**关键要点**:
• Latency breakthrough: Moonshine Medium achieves 107ms on MacBook Pro vs Whisper Large v3's 11,286ms—105x faster—while using 245M vs 1.5B parameters and delivering lower word error rate (6.65% vs 7.44%)
• Architectural fixes for streaming: Eliminates Whisper's fixed 30-second window (wasted compute on zero-padding) and adds encoder/decoder state caching, enabling incremental processing as users speak
• Language-specific models beat multilingual: Training separate models per language (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Arabic) yields higher accuracy at same size than Whisper's 82-language approach where only 33 languages achieve <20% WER
• Cross-platform deployment: Single C++ core with OnnxRuntime powers native libraries for Python, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, Windows, and Raspberry Pi—addressing Whisper's fragmented edge ecosystem
• Edge viability: Tiny 34M model runs at 34ms on MacBook, 237ms on Raspberry Pi 5, making voice interfaces feasible on IoT/wearables where Whisper fails (Whisper Tiny takes 5,863ms on Pi)

**背景**: OpenAI's Whisper (2022) became the open-source STT standard but was designed for batch transcription, not live voice interfaces. Its 30-second fixed window and lack of caching create fundamental latency barriers for real-time applications. Moonshine's creators built on Whisper's foundation but rearchitected specifically for streaming use cases where sub-200ms responsiveness is critical.

### 🟡 Goodbye innerHTML, Hello setHTML: Stronger XSS Protection in Firefox 148
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.2/10

**为什么重要**: Firefox 148 ships the first standardized browser-native defense against XSS, finally giving developers a safe-by-default alternative to the notoriously vulnerable innerHTML pattern without requiring security expertise or architectural overhauls.

**要点**:
• setHTML() sanitizes malicious HTML automatically: `<h1>Hello my name is <img src='x' onclick='alert('XSS')'>` becomes `<h1>Hello my name is</h1>` by removing dangerous elements and attributes
• CSP, Firefox's previous XSS defense spearheaded in 2009, failed to protect the 'long tail of the web' due to requiring 'significant architectural changes' and 'continuous review by security experts'
• XSS has ranked in the top 3 web vulnerabilities (CWE-79) for nearly a decade and remains 'notoriously difficult to prevent' despite decades of mitigation efforts

### 🟡 I'm helping my dog vibe code games
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.1/10

**为什么重要**: This demonstrates a surprisingly robust framework for autonomous AI game development through creative prompt engineering, automated feedback loops, and hardware integration—showing how far LLMs can go with the right scaffolding.

**要点**:
• The critical innovation was a persona-based prompt framing Momo's random keystrokes as intentional cryptic commands from 'an eccentric video game designer,' enabling Claude to creatively interpret gibberish like 'y7u8888888ftrg34BC' into a 3D frog bug-catching game concept.
• Automated feedback loops—screenshots and simulated input sequences that let Claude play-test its own games—were 'the single biggest lever for fewer duds,' with the author observing Claude voluntarily play through 6 stages to verify a boss fight fix.
• Godot's text-based .tscn scene format proved decisive over Unity and Bevy; Claude could directly read and edit scene files, whereas Unity's MCP bridge 'frequently hung' and Bevy's coordinate conventions and sparse training data caused persistent issues.
