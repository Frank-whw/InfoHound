### MuMu Player (NetEase) silently runs 17 reconnaissance commands every 30 minutes
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: A widely-used Android emulator is performing covert surveillance-level data collection on macOS users every 30 minutes, including network scans, process monitoring, and hardware fingerprinting—all undisclosed in its privacy policy.

**一句话总结**: MuMu Player Pro for macOS silently executes 17 system reconnaissance commands every 30 minutes, collecting detailed network, process, and hardware data tied to users' Mac serial numbers without disclosure.

**关键要点**:
• Comprehensive data collection: 17 commands run automatically including `arp -a` (all network devices), `ps aux` (every running process with full arguments), `cat /etc/hosts`, `sysctl -a` (kernel parameters), and full application inventory via `mdls`—generating ~400KB per collection
• Critical privacy exposure: Process lists capture VPN configurations, session tokens in command-line arguments, development environments, security tools, and user directory paths—creating a behavioral timeline exploitable for targeting or evasion
• Persistent hardware tracking: Mac serial numbers are harvested and used as immutable identifiers via SensorsData analytics, combined with campaign tracking (UTM sources, player versions) in an 86KB message queue
• Transparency failure: None of the 30-minute scheduled collections—network enumeration, process monitoring, hosts file reading—are mentioned in MuMu's published privacy policy
• Verification is trivial: Users can confirm the activity by checking `~/Library/Application Support/com.netease.mumu.nemux-global/logs/` for timestamped directories containing raw command outputs

**背景**: MuMu Player is a popular Android emulator developed by NetEase, a major Chinese technology company. SensorsData is a Beijing-based analytics platform commonly used for user behavior tracking in Chinese software. The discovery was made on MuMu Player Pro v1.8.5 for Apple Silicon Macs.
