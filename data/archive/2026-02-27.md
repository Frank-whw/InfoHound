### What Claude Code Chooses
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 8.3/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This reveals how AI coding assistants are quietly reshaping developer tool adoption by defaulting to custom-built solutions over established vendors, creating a new 'invisible' stack that could disrupt SaaS markets.

**一句话总结**: Claude Code prefers building custom solutions over buying tools in 12 of 20 categories, but when it does recommend tools, it creates near-monopolies for GitHub Actions (94%), Stripe (91%), and shadcn/ui (90%).

**关键要点**:
• Build vs. buy split: 252 total 'Custom/DIY' picks—more than any individual tool—including hand-rolled feature flags with env vars instead of LaunchDarkly, and JWT+bcrypt auth instead of Auth0
• Near-monopoly tools: GitHub Actions 93.8% (152/162), Stripe 91.4% (64/70), shadcn/ui 90.1% (64/71), Vercel 100% for JS deployments
• Invisible incumbents: Express got 0/119 primary picks, Redux 0/88, Jest only 7/171 (4%), AWS/GCP/Azure zero primary deployment picks in any stack
• Model recency gradient: Opus 4.6 picks Drizzle 100% vs. Sonnet 4.5's Prisma 79%; Celery drops from 100% to 0% across Python job picks
• Deployment stack lock-in: Vercel owns JS (100%), Railway owns Python (82%)—traditional cloud providers barely mentioned as alternatives

**背景**: StudyEdwin analyzed 2,430 Claude Code responses across 3 models (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5, Opus 4.6) and 4 project types, using open-ended prompts without tool names to observe natural tool selection behavior.

### 🟡 How my side project got banned from the internet
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.4/10

**为什么重要**: This article exposes how fragile web reputation systems are and how a single false positive can cascade across 10+ security vendors, potentially destroying businesses that depend on web traffic.

**要点**:
• Google Safe Browsing cleared the flag in 2 hours, but 9 other vendors had already replicated it—demonstrating how security databases propagate errors virally without verification
• Vendor resolution times varied dramatically: CRDF (1 day), BitDefender (3 days), alphaMountain.ai/Fortinet (4 days), CyRadar (6 days), Seclookup (8 days), Gridinsoft (16 days), with ESET and Lionic never responding
• The root cause was a 302 temporary redirect (engramma.dev → app.engramma.dev) combined with a newly registered domain—a pattern security systems associate with malicious actors
