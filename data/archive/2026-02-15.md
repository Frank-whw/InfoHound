### Vim 9.2 released
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.9/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Vim 9.2 modernizes a 30-year-old editor with native Wayland support, AI-ready scripting capabilities, and sensible defaults that finally match contemporary developer expectations without sacrificing its legendary efficiency.

**一句话总结**: Vim 9.2 releases with major Vim9 scripting enhancements including enums and generics, experimental Wayland support, fuzzy completion, and updated defaults like 'history' increasing from 50 to 200 and 'backspace' finally working intuitively out-of-the-box.

**关键要点**:
• Vim9 scripting matures with native Enums, Generic functions, and Tuple data types—demonstrated by AI-generated projects like a complete Battleship game and Number Puzzle using GitHub Copilot, signaling production-readiness for complex plugins
• Platform modernization includes experimental Wayland UI/clipboard support and XDG Base Directory compliance ($HOME/.config/vim), addressing long-standing Linux desktop integration pain points
• Diff mode gains the 'linematch' algorithm and 'diffanchors' for section-specific comparisons, with inline highlighting now defaulting to 'inline:char' for character-level change visibility
• Completion system adds fuzzy matching (CTRL-X CTRL-R from registers), 'completeopt' flags like 'nosort' and 'nearest', and responsive auto-completion architecture that scales irrespective of file size
• Default values modernized after decades: 'history' 50→200, 'backspace' empty→'indent,eol,start', 'showcmd'/'ruler' now always on, GTK 'fontsize' 10pt→12pt for HiDPI—removing friction for new users

**背景**: Vim 9.0 (2022) introduced the Vim9 scripting language—a major break from legacy Vimscript with stricter typing and compiled performance. Version 9.2 represents the ecosystem maturation, with contributor Yegappan Lakshmanan leveraging these modern constructs for AI-assisted development tools.
