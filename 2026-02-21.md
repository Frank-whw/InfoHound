### Turn Dependabot Off
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.9/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Dependabot's noisy alerts create alert fatigue that actually reduces security by drowning real vulnerabilities in false positives, while smarter tools like govulncheck use static analysis to eliminate this waste.

**一句话总结**: Dependabot should be replaced with scheduled GitHub Actions running govulncheck and testing against latest dependencies to eliminate false positive noise and enable actual security triage.

**关键要点**:
• Dependabot generated thousands of PRs for a filippo.io/edwards25519 vulnerability affecting only the unused (*Point).MultiScalarMult method, even flagging repos like Wycheproof that only imported the unaffected sub-package filippo.io/edwards25519/field
• govulncheck uses the Go Vulnerability Database's rich metadata (version, package, symbol) and static analysis to filter alerts by actual reachability—correctly reporting 'No vulnerabilities found' when the vulnerable symbol isn't callable
• The Go Vulnerability Database includes per-symbol vulnerability data (e.g., 'Point.MultiScalarMult' specifically) enabling precise filtering that module-level scanners miss
• Running CI with 'go get -u -t ./...' daily captures breakage detection benefits without forcing immediate updates, letting teams update on their own schedule while maintaining security readiness
• Alert fatigue from false positives causes teams to treat all alerts as routine dependency bumps, making proper security response (production updates, secret rotation, user notification) impractical when real vulnerabilities occur

**背景**: The author is Filippo Valsorda, former Go Security Team lead (2020–2021) who drove creation of the Go Vulnerability Database and govulncheck; the article references his own module filippo.io/edwards25519 which has 228k+ dependents through github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql

### 🟡 "Made in EU" - it was harder than I thought
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.5/10

**为什么重要**: This article provides a rare practical roadmap for building on European infrastructure, exposing hidden friction points that most 'cloud exit' discussions gloss over.

**要点**:
• The final stack: Hetzner (compute), Scaleway (email, registry, observability), Bunny.net (CDN/DNS), Nebius (GPU inference), Hanko (auth), plus self-hosted Gitea, Plausible, Twenty CRM, Infisical, and Bugsink on Kubernetes with Rancher.
• Unexpected pain points: EU transactional email lacks ecosystem depth vs. Sendgrid/Postmark, leaving GitHub means rebuilding CI/CD and losing social integrations, and certain TLDs cost 2-3x more through European registrars with no clear explanation.
• Unavoidable American dependencies: Google Ads and Apple Developer Program for user acquisition/distribution, social login OAuth flows (Google/Apple) for conversion optimization, and frontier AI models like Claude requiring transatlantic API calls.
