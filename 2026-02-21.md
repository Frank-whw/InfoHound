### Turn Dependabot Off
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.3/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Dependabot's false-positive-heavy alerts create alert fatigue that actually reduces security by drowning real vulnerabilities in noise, while better alternatives like govulncheck use static analysis to only flag genuinely reachable vulnerabilities.

**一句话总结**: The author argues Dependabot should be replaced with govulncheck and scheduled CI tests against latest dependencies to eliminate false positives and enable meaningful security triage.

**关键要点**:
• Dependabot generated thousands of PRs for a filippo.io/edwards25519 vulnerability affecting only the unused (*Point).MultiScalarMult method, even flagging repos like Wycheproof that only imported the unaffected field subpackage
• The Go Vulnerability Database includes rich metadata (version, package, symbol) enabling precise filtering; govulncheck uses static analysis to determine if vulnerable code is actually reachable, returning 'No vulnerabilities found' when the symbol isn't called
• Alert fatigue from false positives causes teams to treat all alerts as routine dependency bumps, preventing proper impact assessment (production updates, secret rotation, user notification) for real vulnerabilities
• Scheduled CI running 'go get -u -t ./...' before tests captures breakage detection benefits without forcing immediate updates, letting teams control when to actually bump dependencies
• Noisy scanners externalize costs to open source maintainers who receive spurious update demands; the author, as former Go Security Team lead, invested in govulncheck specifically to solve this systemic problem

**背景**: Dependabot is GitHub's automated dependency update tool that scans for security vulnerabilities and opens PRs to update affected packages. The Go ecosystem has a specialized vulnerability database and govulncheck tool developed by the Go Security Team that performs deeper static analysis than generic scanners.

### 🟡 I found a Vulnerability. They found a Lawyer
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.5/10

**为什么重要**: This case exposes how organizations often punish rather than reward security researchers, revealing systemic failures in vulnerability disclosure culture that ultimately leaves user data—including children's—at risk.

**要点**:
• The vulnerability was trivial: incrementing numeric user IDs (XXXXXX0, XXXXXXX1, etc.) combined with a static default password never enforced to be changed, allowing access to full profiles including 14-year-old students' names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers with no rate limiting, lockouts, or MFA.
• The researcher followed Malta's National Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy by reporting to both CSIRT Malta and the organization directly with a 30-day embargo, offering technical assistance and receiving a legal threat in return.
• The organization's law firm explicitly criticized the researcher for 'notifying the authorities prior to contacting the Group' and threatened criminal prosecution under Maltese law for the 'threat to make this matter public.'

### 🟡 Brat, a parallel TAP testing harness for the POSIX shell
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.0/10

**为什么重要**: Brat solves the common pain point of slow shell test suites by offering built-in parallel execution without external dependencies, while remaining readable enough to understand in an afternoon.

**要点**:
• Zero dependencies: Runs on POSIX.1-2024 with only shell and awk, tested on Alpine (busybox), Debian (dash/mawk), Fedora (bash/gawk), FreeBSD, and macOS
• Built-in parallel execution via -j flag or $BRAT_JOBS environment variable, using FIFOs instead of requiring GNU parallel
• Different output model from Bats: captures to $stdout/$stderr file paths rather than $output/$lines strings, avoiding memory overhead with large outputs
