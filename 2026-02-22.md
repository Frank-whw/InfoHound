### How I use Claude Code: Separation of planning and execution
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.5/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This article presents a battle-tested workflow that solves the #1 failure mode of AI coding tools: producing code that works in isolation but breaks existing systems, by enforcing human review before any code is written.

**一句话总结**: The author describes a rigorous 3-phase workflow for Claude Code that separates planning from execution through mandatory research documentation, iterative plan annotation, and strict implementation protocols, resulting in dramatically better outcomes with minimal token usage.

**关键要点**:
• Research phase requires 'deep-read' directives with explicit language ('deeply', 'intricacies') and produces a persistent research.md file that serves as a review surface to catch misunderstandings before they propagate to implementation
• The annotation cycle is the critical differentiator: the author adds inline notes directly to plan.md (correcting assumptions, rejecting approaches, injecting domain knowledge), then sends Claude back to revise—repeating 1-6 times until satisfied, with explicit 'don't implement yet' guards
• A standardized implementation prompt enforces mechanical execution: 'implement it all', 'mark as completed in the plan document', 'do not stop until all tasks are completed', 'continuously run typecheck'—ensuring the creative work happens in planning, not coding
• The workflow prevents the most expensive failure mode: implementations that ignore existing caching layers, duplicate logic, or violate ORM conventions—problems that stem from Claude skimming rather than deeply understanding the codebase
• Using persistent markdown files rather than chat or built-in plan mode creates 'shared mutable state' enabling precise, location-specific feedback without context loss, and produces reviewable artifacts that outlive any single session

**背景**: The author has used Claude Code as their primary development tool for ~9 months and contrasts their approach with common anti-patterns: prompt-fix-repeat loops, 'ralph loops', MCPs, and other 'terminally online' configurations that produce messes for non-trivial work.
