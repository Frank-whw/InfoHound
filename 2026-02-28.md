### Accidentally disabling SSH access via scp
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This reveals a dangerous edge case where a routine file transfer can silently lock you out of your own server, with implications for automated deployment scripts and backup procedures that many developers rely on.

**一句话总结**: SCP's permission-preserving behavior can overwrite existing directory permissions on the destination, causing sshd to reject authentication when home directory permissions become too permissive (777).

**关键要点**:
• SCP recursively copies permissions from source to destination even when the target directory already exists, unlike cp which typically preserves existing directory permissions
• OpenSSH's sshd enforces strict permission checks on the server side: home directories must be 700 (rwx------) or stricter, or authentication is refused with 'bad ownership or modes' in logs
• The specific trigger was `scp -r . host:` where a local 777 directory was copied to the home directory, overwriting its 700 permissions
• The author only recovered because they had physical access to the SD card and an alternative WebDAV access method—remote servers without these fallbacks would require console access or recovery modes
• OpenSSH fixed this in version 10.3 after a same-day bug report, indicating it was recognized as a legitimate security/usability issue

**背景**: SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a legacy but widely-used OpenSSH tool for file transfers. Many administrators assume it behaves like standard Unix cp for permissions, but it implements its own protocol with different semantics. The sshd permission check on the server side is a long-standing security feature to prevent other users from injecting malicious authorized_keys entries.

### 🟡 Statement on the comments from Secretary of War Pete Hegseth
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.5/10

**为什么重要**: This represents a major escalation in the tension between AI safety commitments and government demands, with potential precedent-setting implications for how American tech companies negotiate national security contracts.

**要点**:
• Anthropic has been negotiating with the Department of War for months, seeking two narrow exceptions to lawful AI use: no mass domestic surveillance of Americans and no fully autonomous weapons deployment
• The company has supported American warfighters since June 2024 as the first frontier AI company to deploy models in classified government networks
• A supply chain risk designation under 10 USC 3252 is historically reserved for US adversaries and has never before been publicly applied to an American company

### 🟡 科技爱好者周刊（第 386 期）：当外卖员接入 AI
**来源**: 阮一峰科技爱好者周刊 | **评分**: 7.4/10

**为什么重要**: This article reveals a paradigm shift where AI systems can now programmatically orchestrate human labor through gig economy platforms, fundamentally expanding automation beyond digital tasks into physical world execution.

**要点**:
• Waymo pays gig workers $6.25-$11.25 per task to manually close doors on its driverless taxis when passengers fail to do so, rather than building remote door-closing technology
• The critical insight: gig workers have become 'human APIs'—standardized, on-demand labor accessible through software interfaces—enabling programs to invoke human action as part of automated workflows
• This pattern suggests AI's next evolution: from manipulating computers (OpenClaw) to orchestrating hybrid 'machine + human' systems, with applications like AI-managed home renovation where the model designs, dispatches workers, and handles payments autonomously
