### An AI agent coding skeptic tries AI agent coding, in excessive detail
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This is one of the few rigorous, hype-free evaluations of AI agent coding from someone who actually measured productivity gains against costs rather than parroting marketing claims.

**一句话总结**: An experienced LLM skeptic documents their methodical, real-world testing of Claude Opus 4.5 for coding tasks, finding that structured prompting via AGENTS.md files and specific constraints yield genuine but bounded productivity improvements.

**关键要点**:
• The author created an intricate AGENTS.md file with 20+ rules (using ALL CAPS for critical constraints like 'MUST avoid redundant comments' and 'NEVER use emoji') and found it was likely the main differentiator between good and bad agent results—a practice they consider underappreciated.
• Opus 4.5 successfully built a YouTube metadata scraper handling 20,000 videos with Pythonic code quality that surpassed the author's 2021 implementation, but only after explicit constraints like 'Do not use the Google Client SDK' and structured prompting via tracked Markdown files.
• Earlier failures with Sonnet 4.5 (creating 'overly verbose Jupyter Notebooks') and mixed results with Copilot for grid image processing (errors in row/column ordering) demonstrate that agent capabilities remain task-dependent and require human oversight.
• The author's workflow explicitly rejects Anthropic's simplified prompting advice in favor of detailed, version-controlled prompt files with functional requirements the agent 'cannot magically apply because it cannot read minds.'
• Productivity gains were real but measured: grid.py implementation was 'material' but not transformative, and the author remains 'more optimistic' yet explicitly 'not nearly enough to become an AI hypester.'

**背景**: The author previously wrote 'As an Experienced LLM User, I Actually Don't Use Generative LLMs Often' (May 2025) criticizing agentic coding as unpredictable and overhyped; this post documents their updated methodology and findings after Anthropic's November 2025 Opus 4.5 release.
