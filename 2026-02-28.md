### Accidentally disabling SSH access via scp
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This reveals a dangerous, counterintuitive behavior in scp that can silently lock you out of remote systems—a risk that affects anyone using common file transfer workflows without realizing the permission inheritance trap.

**一句话总结**: scp recursively copies not just files but also their permissions to the target directory, and when that target is your home directory with 777 permissions, sshd rejects your key for security reasons, completely disabling SSH access.

**关键要点**:
• scp -r . host: copies the current directory's contents to the remote home directory, but also overwrites the target directory's permissions to match the source—changing a 700 home directory to 777 if the source had those permissions
• sshd enforces strict permission checks on the server side too: it refuses publickey authentication when the home directory is world-writable (777), logging 'Authentication refused: bad ownership or modes for directory'
• The author discovered this through a WebDAV backup access, then reproduced it: a 700 remote_directory became 777 after scp -r from a 777 local directory, confirming the behavior
• OpenSSH acknowledged and fixed the bug within hours; the patch was committed for release 10.3, indicating this was recognized as a legitimate security/usability issue
• Workaround: always verify source directory permissions before scp -r, or use rsync with --no-perms, or explicitly chmod the target directory after transfer

**背景**: OpenSSH's scp has historically tried to preserve file metadata including permissions, but this behavior becomes dangerous when the implicit target (the home directory) has its permissions overwritten. The sshd server-side check mirrors the client-side warning about private key files being 'too open'—both enforce that authentication-related paths must be restricted to the owner only.

### 🟡 Please stop using passkeys for encrypting user data
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.4/10

**为什么重要**: Organizations are increasingly using passkeys for encryption without considering that users routinely delete credentials they don't recognize, risking permanent loss of irreplaceable data like family photos and financial records.

**要点**:
• The PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension in WebAuthn is being used by organizations to derive encryption keys for end-to-end encryption, message backups, documents, crypto wallets, and credential manager unlocking—expanding passkeys beyond their intended authentication purpose
• A realistic user scenario illustrates the danger: 'Erika' deletes a passkey she doesn't remember creating, then loses access to encrypted backups containing photos of deceased relatives when she switches phones a year later
• Current credential manager UIs (Apple Passwords, Google Password Manager, Bitwarden) show no warnings about data destruction when deleting passkeys with PRF enabled, and users cannot reasonably be expected to remember technical coupling decisions made months prior

### 🟡 科技爱好者周刊（第 386 期）：当外卖员接入 AI
**来源**: 阮一峰科技爱好者周刊 | **评分**: 7.4/10

**为什么重要**: This article reveals a paradigm shift where AI moves beyond digital automation to orchestrate physical human labor, fundamentally changing how we think about workforce integration and the future of gig economy platforms.

**要点**:
• Waymo pays DoorDash workers $6.25-$11.25 per task to manually close car doors when passengers leave them open, rather than building remote door-closing technology
• The critical insight: gig workers function as 'human APIs'—already plugged into software systems, making them programmatically callable for physical tasks that robots cannot yet handle
• This hybrid 'machine + human' automation model could expand AI's scope dramatically; the author envisions AI managing entire home renovations by dispatching and coordinating human specialists (electricians, carpenters, inspectors) through automated task distribution
