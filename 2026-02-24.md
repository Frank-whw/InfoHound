### I Ported Coreboot to the ThinkPad X270
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.1/10 🔴

**为什么重要**: This is a rare, detailed walkthrough of a real-world Coreboot porting effort that exposes the messy reality of hardware hacking—from accidentally launching capacitors into orbit to deciphering schematics—while demonstrating how open-source firmware development actually happens through community collaboration.

**一句话总结**: A developer successfully ported Coreboot/Libreboot to the ThinkPad X270 in under a week, overcoming hardware damage and PCIe configuration differences from the similar X280 through schematic analysis and community support from Libreboot's founder.

**关键要点**:
• Hardware damage is routine: The author knocked off a 10uF 0603 capacitor twice during SOIC-8 clip flashing, requiring DigiKey replacement and schematic analysis using 'PJ304' silkscreen markings to identify the correct component.
• The X270/X280 difference that mattered: While both share Kaby Lake chipsets, the X270 uses CLKREQ2/CLKOUT2 for WiFi (vs. disconnected on X280), requiring PCIe clock request renumbering that fixed NVMe and wireless detection failures.
• deguard enables ME neutering without vulnerability requirement: The author clarified that Intel Management Engine delta patching works with any patched ME image, not just vulnerable versions—producing a 'HAP-bit and Deguarded' IME.
• Toolchain: RP2040-zero with pico-serprog + flashprog for SPI dumping, ifdtool for Intel Flash Descriptor extraction, and careful preservation of GbE/IFD regions from stock BIOS for functional ethernet.
• Community debugging: Libreboot founder Leah Rowe personally assisted with multiple test ROMs, demonstrating how niche firmware development relies on direct expert collaboration rather than documentation.

**背景**: Coreboot is an open-source firmware alternative to proprietary BIOS/UEFI; Libreboot is a downstream distribution that removes binary blobs. The ThinkPad X270 (20HM, Kaby Lake) lacked Coreboot support despite the similar X280 being supported. 'deguard' is a tool for patching Intel ME to reduce its capabilities.

### 🟡 So I've Been Thinking About Static Site Generators
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 7.0/10

**为什么重要**: This article reveals why even 'fast' SSGs like Hugo and Zola fail at true incremental builds, and proposes a concrete solution using Rust's Red-Green algorithm to achieve sub-100ms rebuilds.

**要点**:
• Profiling Astro revealed that only 0.4s of a 12.34s build was spent in syscalls—the rest was JavaScript overhead, motivating a compiled-language rewrite
• The author identifies a critical flaw in naive incremental builds: changing one page's content can trigger full-site rebuilds when next/previous links cause 'collection of all metadata' to be marked dirty
• The Red-Green algorithm (used by Rust's compiler) enables 'green' (unchanged) outputs even with 'red' (changed) dependencies, breaking the over-rebuild chain by verifying actual output changes
