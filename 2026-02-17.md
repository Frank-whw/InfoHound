### Let's practice! (bsd.rd)
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.1/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Understanding bsd.rd's layered structure demystifies a critical OpenBSD rescue/install tool and reveals how the developers intentionally embedded documentation in the man page cross-references, making this a masterclass in self-directed systems learning.

**一句话总结**: OpenBSD's bsd.rd is a gzip-compressed ELF kernel containing an embedded FFS miniroot filesystem that can be extracted, examined, and modified on a running system using standard tools following a trail documented in interconnected man pages.

**关键要点**:
• bsd.rd consists of four nested layers: gzip compression → ELF binary → embedded ramdisk space (3.59 MB) → FFS miniroot filesystem, each accessible with standard Unix tools
• The OpenBSD developers designed a deliberate learning path through SEE ALSO links: rd(4) → rdsetroot(8) → vnconfig(8) → vnd(4), with each man page pointing to the next required tool
• The miniroot contains a single 65KB install.sub ksh script that handles install, upgrade, and autoinstall modes by checking $0, demonstrating economy of design
• The .profile generates version/architecture strings at runtime via sysctl rather than hardcoding, allowing the same miniroot image to work across releases
• The complete installer toolbox fits in ~3.6MB with only essential binaries: fdisk/disklabel for partitioning, ftp for downloads, signify for verification, and installboot for boot sectors

**背景**: bsd.rd is OpenBSD's RAM disk kernel used for installation, upgrades, and system recovery. Unlike most users who only boot it, this lab demonstrates how to dissect its internal structure on a live system without rebooting, following documentation trails that the developers intentionally built into the manual page system.

**为什么重要**: This demonstrates a concrete alternative to chat-based AI tools that could fundamentally change how developers navigate codebases, moving from keyword search to semantic understanding without the friction of conversational interfaces.

**要点**:
• The tool recursively clusters files by semantic similarity using spectral clustering (linear algebra-based, no manual tuning), handling up to ~10,000 files in minutes on a modern MacBook
• A key UX breakthrough: labeling sibling clusters together rather than independently produces distinctive, non-generic names—earlier iterations produced multiple clusters all labeled 'type errors'
• The 'homework' prompting technique improves label quality by asking the model to produce structured intermediate reasoning (overarchingTheme, distinguishingFeature) even though only the final label is used
