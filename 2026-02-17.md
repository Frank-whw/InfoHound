### Study: Self-generated Agent Skills are useless
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 8.3/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: This research challenges a core assumption in AI agent development—that models can self-improve by generating their own procedural knowledge—revealing that human-curated skills remain essential for reliable performance gains.

**一句话总结**: A comprehensive benchmark of 7,308 agent trajectories shows that while curated Agent Skills boost task completion by 16.2 percentage points, self-generated Skills provide zero average benefit, indicating LLMs cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they need to consume.

**关键要点**:
• Curated Skills deliver substantial but uneven gains: +16.2pp average improvement, ranging from +4.5pp (Software Engineering) to +51.9pp (Healthcare), with 16 of 84 tasks actually showing performance degradation
• Self-generated Skills completely fail: despite the intuition that models should craft their own helpful procedures, they provide no average benefit across 7,308 trajectories and 7 agent-model configurations
• Focused beats comprehensive: Skills with just 2-3 targeted modules outperform lengthy documentation, suggesting precision matters more than coverage
• Skills enable model efficiency: smaller models equipped with curated Skills can match larger models without them, offering a potential path to cost-effective deployment
• The SkillsBench framework provides deterministic verifiers and 86 tasks across 11 domains, establishing a standard for measuring Skill effectiveness that was previously absent from the field

**背景**: Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge (like tool-use patterns, API workflows, or domain-specific procedures) that augment LLM agents at inference time. They've seen rapid adoption in frameworks like LangChain and AutoGPT, but without standardized evaluation, their actual effectiveness remained unclear—particularly the popular assumption that agents could bootstrap their own Skills through self-improvement loops.

### 🟡 Let's practice! (bsd.rd)
**来源**: Lobste.rs | **评分**: 8.1/10

**为什么重要**: Understanding bsd.rd's layered structure demystifies how OpenBSD's rescue/install environment works and shows admins how to modify it without rebooting, useful for custom installers or forensics.

**要点**:
• bsd.rd has three nested layers: gzip compression → ELF binary (kernel) → embedded FFS filesystem (miniroot), all of which can be peeled back without rebooting
• The embedded ramdisk is exactly 3,768,320 bytes (~3.6MB) reserved via RAMDISK kernel option and accessed via rd(4) driver; extracted with rdsetroot -x
• The miniroot's install.sub script (65KB) handles all three modes—install, upgrade, autoinstall—by checking $0, with version/architecture determined at runtime via sysctl for cross-release compatibility

### 🟡 What your Bluetooth devices reveal
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.1/10

**为什么重要**: Bluetooth is ubiquitously enabled on billions of devices yet most users remain unaware that passive scanning can reveal detailed behavioral patterns, physical routines, and social connections without ever connecting to their devices.

**要点**:
• Passive Bluetooth scanning with a Raspberry Pi or laptop can detect: delivery vehicle patterns, neighbor daily routines, device correlations (phone + smartwatch), and precise presence/absence times without any connection attempt
• Critical vulnerability WhisperPair (CVE-2025-36911) disclosed days prior affects hundreds of millions of audio devices, enabling remote hijacking, eavesdropping, and location tracking via Google's Find Hub network
• Many devices lack disable options: hearing aids, pacemakers, fleet vehicles, pet GPS collars, and fitness equipment broadcast continuously regardless of user preference
