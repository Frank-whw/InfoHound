### Show HN: Micasa – track your house from the terminal
**来源**: Hacker News | **评分**: 7.0/10 🟡

**为什么重要**: Home maintenance data is typically scattered across cloud apps, spreadsheets, and physical shoeboxes—Micasa offers a privacy-respecting, offline-first alternative that developers can actually stick with because it lives in their terminal.

**一句话总结**: Micasa is a terminal-based, keyboard-driven home management tool that stores all house data—maintenance, projects, appliances, vendors, and documents—in a single local SQLite file with no cloud dependencies.

**关键要点**:
• Architecture: Single SQLite file stores everything including attached documents (manuals, invoices, photos), enabling simple backups via cp—no network calls, no vendor lock-in, no subscription fatigue
• Feature coverage: Tracks 7 core domains—maintenance schedules with auto-computed due dates, projects from concept to completion/abandonment, incidents with severity/location, appliance warranty status, vendor history with quote comparisons, and document attachments
• Interface design: Vim-style modal keybindings (nav/edit modes), fuzzy search, column sorting/hiding, and drill-down navigation inspired by VisiData—optimized for developers who already live in terminals
• Distribution: Go 1.25+ source install or prebuilt binaries for Linux/macOS/Windows on amd64/arm64; includes --demo flag for 30-second evaluation without setup
• Philosophy: Explicit rejection of SaaS patterns—'No cloud. No account. No subscriptions'—positioned as permanent personal infrastructure rather than recurring cost

**背景**: The creator built Micasa to replace a 'shoebox of receipts and vague feelings' about home maintenance, reflecting broader developer frustration with fragmented, cloud-dependent productivity tools and the resurgence of local-first software.
